NSFW. Code is fine to browse, but running the app... you've been warned!

iOS and macOS application that hooks into the RedTube web api.
The code is only a few lines of code. Project is a starting point. 
I think it's best use would be on Apple TV since both Mac and iOS already have web browsers that can view this type of content.

Would also like to add support for more sources, however I found it difficult to get search working with sites like Pornhub.

It may actually be worth creating a Vapor web app to pair with this that can do the crawling of other websites and feed that data into the app.

One major problem/benefit with this whole approach is that it bypasses Ads.
